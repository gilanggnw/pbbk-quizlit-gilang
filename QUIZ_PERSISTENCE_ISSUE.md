# Quiz Persistence Issue - Demo Explanation

## 🔍 **Issue Analysis**

The reason you're seeing "Quiz created successfully!" but no quizzes on the home page is due to **in-memory storage** that gets reset when the server restarts.

### What's Happening:

1. **Quiz Creation**: ✅ Working - Quizzes are created and stored in memory
2. **Server Memory**: 🔄 Temporary - Storage is lost when server stops/restarts  
3. **Dashboard Loading**: ❌ Empty - No persistent storage to load from

## 🧪 **How to Verify This Issue**

### Test 1: Create Quiz and Check Immediately
1. Create a quiz via file upload
2. Immediately navigate to `/dashboard` 
3. **Expected**: Quiz should appear (still in memory)

### Test 2: Check After Server Restart  
1. Stop the server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Restart the server (`go run main.go`)
3. Navigate to `/dashboard`
4. **Expected**: Quiz list is empty (memory cleared)

## ✅ **Quick Demo Solution** 

For your presentation, here are two immediate approaches:

### Option 1: Keep Server Running (Recommended for Demo)
- Don't restart the server during your presentation
- Create quizzes and navigate to dashboard in same session
- Quizzes will persist as long as server runs

### Option 2: Test with Frontend Mock Data
The frontend already has mock data fallback in `quiz-service.ts`:
```typescript
// Fallback to mock data if API fails
return mockQuizzes;
```

## 🔧 **The Real Solution** (For Later Implementation)

I've prepared a proper persistent storage solution, but let's implement it after your demo to avoid any complications:

### Persistent Storage Options:
1. **JSON File Storage** (Simple) - Saves quizzes to `quizzes.json`
2. **SQLite Database** (Better) - Local database file  
3. **PostgreSQL/MySQL** (Production) - Full database server

## 📝 **For Your Demo Right Now**

### Step 1: Start Server and Keep It Running
```bash
cd C:\Users\User\Documents\PBKK\quizlit\pbkk-quizlit\be
go run main.go
```

### Step 2: Test Quiz Creation Flow
1. Upload a file at `/create`
2. Wait for "Quiz created successfully!"
3. Navigate to `/dashboard`
4. Your quiz should appear

### Step 3: Frontend Endpoint
Make sure your frontend is calling the right dashboard: 
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` (not just `/`)
- The home page (`/`) is just a landing page
- The quiz list is on `/dashboard`

## 🚀 **Demo Success Tips**

1. **Start fresh**: Restart backend once before demo
2. **Create 2-3 quizzes**: Shows the list functionality  
3. **Don't restart server** during presentation
4. **Use the dashboard route**: `/dashboard` not `/`
5. **Have backup**: If issues arise, mention the mock data fallback
