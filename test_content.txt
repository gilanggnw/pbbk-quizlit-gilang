Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models. These models enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning with labeled training data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in data without labels  
3. Neural Networks - Computational models inspired by biological neural networks
4. Deep Learning - A subset of machine learning using multi-layered neural networks

Applications of machine learning are widespread and include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
