Probability Theory and Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is a fundamental concept in probability theory. It represents the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. The conditional probability of event A given event B is denoted as P(A|B).

Key Formulas:
- Conditional Probability: P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B)
- Marginal Probability: The probability of an event regardless of other events
- Joint Probability: The probability of two or more events occurring together

Probability Paths:
In probability trees, we can trace paths from initial events to final outcomes. Each path represents a sequence of conditional probabilities. The probability of a complete path is the product of all conditional probabilities along that path.

Vector Fields and Probability:
In advanced probability theory, vector fields can represent probability distributions over multidimensional spaces. Each vector in the field indicates the direction and magnitude of probability flow.

Key Terminology:
- "Conditional" = Per single data point
- "Marginal" = Across distribution of data points
- Probability Paths: The path from noise to data in statistical models
- Score Functions: Used to evaluate the likelihood of different outcomes

Applications:
Conditional probability is essential in machine learning, statistics, and data science. It helps us understand relationships between variables and make predictions based on observed data.
